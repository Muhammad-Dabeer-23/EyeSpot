# **EyeSpot: Object Detection and Autozoom App**

EyeSpot is an innovative mobile application designed to detect objects in images and automatically zoom to fit the detected object within the boundary. It utilizes the YOLOv5 pre-trained model for efficient and accurate object detection.

## **Features**

  Object Detection: EyeSpot employs YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify objects within images.
  Autozoom: Once an object is detected, EyeSpot automatically adjusts the zoom level to fit the detected object within the boundary of the screen.
  User-Friendly Interface: EyeSpot offers a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to capture images and view detected objects.

## **Getting Started**

Clone the Repository: Clone the EyeSpot repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/eyespot.git

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

    cd eyespot
    flutter pub get

Run the App: Launch the EyeSpot app on your preferred device or emulator:

    flutter run

## **Usage**

  Capture Image: Use the built-in camera functionality to capture an image containing the object you want to detect.

  Detect Object: EyeSpot will automatically process the captured image using the YOLOv5 model to detect objects within the image.

  Autozoom: Once an object is detected, EyeSpot will adjust the zoom level to fit the detected object within the screen boundary.

## Sample App

A sample EyeSpot app demonstrating the object detection and autozoom features will be provided soon. Stay tuned!
